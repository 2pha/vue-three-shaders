# vue-three-shaders

> A Vue.js project

Just an experiment with vue.js, three.js and shaders. This is my first time using vue.js.

View the build [HERE](https://2pha.github.io/vue-three-shaders/build/)

recreation in vue od the react version [HERE](https://github.com/2pha/react-three-shaders)

It implements some of the shaders from [this blog post](https://2pha.com/blog/experimenting-threejs-shaders-and-shadermaterial/) in a vue app.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
